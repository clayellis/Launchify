# Launchify

A couple years ago, Spotify's iOS app was still using a hamburger menu for its top-level navigation. Once you got a few levels deep in the app, it was pretty annoying to have to go all the way back to the top just to switch playlists. 

I decided that since I couldn't change their app for them, I'd create one of my own that would let me launch their app directly into my favorite playlists using their deep-linking schema (which I discovered by copying and pasting a bunch of links until I found the pattern). So I created Launchify, a way to "favorite" certain playlists that would then show up in a Today Widget that you could get to from anywhere on your phone. It was pretty smooth!

But then about two weeks before I released Launchify in the App Store, Spotify updated their app to use a tab bar instead of a hamburger (🙌🏻), effectively rendering my app obsolete (🙃). It was a fun project nonetheless!
